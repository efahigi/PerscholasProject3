# Book Store App
## Introduction
I built a Book store App that allows users to sell and buy books. This application allows client to sign up and login to access CRUD and to order book.
- Sign Up: Users can create an account to access book store.

- Login: Registered users can login and access everything.

 After login in to their account the user directly goes to book add(create) view. Than user can add book, view books and order it. 
 - Create Book

 The Users also can review their order and update or delete their past order. 
 - Order History

## Unsolved Problems
- This app look like a complete website with a nav bar and main section. However, the only issue is the footer. I will work on that in near future.
## Future Enhancements
- I will add more feature like issuing(borrowing) book for the user.
